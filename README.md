*Aptardi_main_xx-xx-xx is the code for analysis of test data that is ran from the command line and operates in the Python3 environment*

*uhr_gold_standard_ML_algorithm_xx-xx-xx is the Python3 code used to train the default supervised machine learning model utilized in Aptardi_main and built from publicly available universal human reference RNA sequencing and PolyA sequencing data*

*Other files contain the individual functions used in Aptardi_main and uhr_gold_standard_ML_algorithm*

*Dependencies other than Python3 and standard Python3 library*
