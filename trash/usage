    -o --organism             The name of the desired organism located on UCSC's FTP server (ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/)
                              The specified organism name must have associated .fa.gz, refGene.txt.gz, and chromInfo.txt.gz files located in its bigZips, database, and database directories, respectively
                              Example usage: -o rn6
                              If using the -o argument, ONLY use the -m argument (and optionally the -d argument) below
                              
    -b --bed                  Path to the gene bed file
                              If using the -b argument, you must also use the -s, -c, -f, and -m arguments
    
    -s --symbol               Path to the gene symbol file
                              If using the -s argument, you must also use the -b, -c, -f, and -m arguments
                              
    -c --chroms               Path to the chromosome sizes file
                              If using the -c argument, you must also use the -b, -s, -f, and -m arguments
    
    -g --gtf                  Path to the gtf file outputted by Cufflinks or StringTie
                              If using the -g argument, you must also use the -c, -f, and -m arguments
    
    -f --fasta                Path to the fasta sequence file
                              If uing the -f argument, you must also use either
                              1. The -b AND -s AND -c AND -m arguments
                              OR
                              2. The -c AND -g AND -m arguments
                              
    -m --bam                  Path to the sorted bam file of RNA sequencing data
    
    -d --stranded             Argument to indicate if the RNA sequencing data are stranded
                              
                              The gtf file should be in the format outputted by Cufflinks or StringTie
                                  These algorithms can be performed on a sorted bam file generated from the RNA sequencing data (see below for how to produce a sorted bam file) to yield an experiment-specific gtf file (recommended)
                              The gene bed, symbol, and chromosome sizes files can be generated from UCSC
                              The chromosome sizes text file should have a line for each chromsome with 2 tab separated fields for each line:
                                  1st field = chromosome, either with or without a leading 'chr'
                                  2nd field = chromosome size
                                  Note: The chromosome sizes file can have comment lines and empty lines
                              The fasta and chromosome sizes file can be .gz compressed
                              The bam file should be sorted 
                                  hisat2/bowtie2 can be used to map RNA sequencing reads
                                  samtools view with the -b argument (i.e. bam file output) can then be used on these data to generate a bam file
                                  Finally, samtools sort can be used to sort the resulting bam file
                              See supporting documentation for more information
